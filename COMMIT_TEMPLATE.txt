feat(project)!: initial public release

Establishes the stable 1.x CLI and formatter behavior for adafmt.

- Establish stable 1.x CLI and formatter behavior
- Integrate Ada Language Server via JSON-RPC; apply LSP TextEdits atomically
- Provide UI modes: pretty, basic, plain, off with auto TTY detection
- Harden error handling (retry on transient ALS issues; detect GNATFORMAT false positives)
- Default to dry-run; require --write for in-place edits
- Support GPR projects with Alire workspace detection and path filtering
- Manage ALS lifecycle with preflight lock cleanup and conflict resolution
- Emit JSONL logs and rich debug output; --check returns non-zero on diffs for CI
- Requirement: ada_language_server must be on PATH (not bundled)

BREAKING CHANGE: First stable release; prior pre-1.0 behavior is not guaranteed compatible.
