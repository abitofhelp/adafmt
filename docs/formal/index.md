# Formal Documentation

This section contains the official project specifications, requirements, and design documents for adafmt. These documents serve as the authoritative source for project requirements, architectural decisions, and compliance information.

## üìã Formal Documents

### [üìã Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](SRS.md)
**Purpose**: Defines the functional and non-functional requirements for adafmt  
**Audience**: Project managers, stakeholders, compliance auditors, developers  
**Contents**:
- Functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-10)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, usability)
- System constraints and assumptions
- Acceptance criteria
- Compliance requirements

**Key Sections**:
- **Section 3**: Functional Requirements - Core formatting capabilities
- **Section 4**: Non-functional Requirements - Performance and reliability standards  
- **Section 5**: System Constraints - Technical limitations and dependencies
- **Appendix A**: Requirements Traceability Matrix

### [üèóÔ∏è Software Design Document (SDD)](SDD.md)
**Purpose**: Documents the architectural design and technical implementation decisions  
**Audience**: Software architects, senior developers, technical reviewers  
**Contents**:
- System architecture overview
- Component design and interfaces
- Data flow and processing logic
- Technology stack justification
- Design patterns and principles
- Security considerations

**Key Sections**:
- **Section 2**: System Architecture - High-level system design
- **Section 3**: Component Design - Detailed module specifications
- **Section 4**: Interface Design - API and protocol specifications
- **Section 5**: Data Design - Data structures and flow
- **Section 6**: Security Design - Security considerations and implementations

### [üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview](architecture.md) *(Coming Soon)*
**Purpose**: High-level system architecture for stakeholders and new developers  
**Audience**: Technical managers, new team members, integration partners  
**Contents**:
- System context and boundaries
- Major components and their interactions
- Technology choices and rationale
- Integration points and external dependencies
- Deployment architecture

   What to build      How to build it    Why built this way
```

### **Traceability**
- **SRS ‚Üí SDD**: Each design decision traces back to specific requirements
- **SDD ‚Üí Code**: Implementation aligns with documented design
- **Requirements ‚Üí Testing**: Test cases verify requirement compliance

### **Document Hierarchy**
1. **SRS**: Defines WHAT the system must do
2. **SDD**: Defines HOW the system accomplishes requirements  
3. **Architecture**: Explains WHY design decisions were made

## üéØ Usage by Role

### **Project Managers**
- **Primary**: [SRS](SRS.md) for scope, timeline, and deliverable planning
- **Secondary**: [SDD](SDD.md) Section 1 (Overview) for technical understanding
- **Focus Areas**: Requirements completeness, acceptance criteria, constraints

### **Software Architects**
- **Primary**: [SDD](SDD.md) for detailed design specifications
- **Secondary**: [SRS](SRS.md) for requirements context
- **Focus Areas**: System architecture, component interfaces, technology decisions

### **Compliance Auditors**
- **Primary**: [SRS](SRS.md) for requirements verification
- **Secondary**: [SDD](SDD.md) for implementation verification
- **Focus Areas**: Requirements traceability, security requirements, quality standards

### **Senior Developers**
- **Primary**: [SDD](SDD.md) for implementation guidance
- **Secondary**: [SRS](SRS.md) for business context
- **Focus Areas**: Component specifications, interface contracts, design patterns

### **New Team Members**
- **Start Here**: [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) *(when available)*
- **Then**: [SRS](SRS.md) Section 1-2 (Introduction and Overview)
- **Finally**: [SDD](SDD.md) Section 2 (System Architecture)
